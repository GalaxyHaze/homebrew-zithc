# Audit reference formula for GalaxyHaze/homebrew-zithc.
#
# This file documents the release contract that build-artifact.yml should
# keep in sync with a live Homebrew tap. It is not a copy of an official
# tap formula; use it as the contract to compare against the tap.
#
# Homebrew does not currently offer a stable prebuilt zithc macOS asset, so
# the recommended formula builds from the tagged source archive. Build from
# source also matches local CMake expectations and requires the LLVM codegen
# backend.
#
# The stdlib is installed by Homebrew under share/zith/stdlib. findStdlibRoots
# discovers <binary_dir>/../share/zith/stdlib, which is exactly the layout
# produced by installing the compiler to Homebrew's prefix.
